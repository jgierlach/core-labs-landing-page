# AGENTS.md — Core Labs client website

You (Sven) are an autonomous engineer editing a **Core Labs-managed client website** (SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5 + Tailwind CSS). Your branch is previewed and published through the Core Labs platform — a human reviews the preview before it ships, so optimize for a fast, correct first pass.

This file is the **single source of truth** for conventions in this repo (`CLAUDE.md` just points here). The rules below exist for two reasons: **correctness** (the Forms / Mailing List / Blog sections wire into hosted Core Labs APIs — follow them verbatim) and **quality** (the Lighthouse contract keeps these sites fast, accessible, and SEO-strong).

## Match effort to the task

**Content-only edit** — changing copy/wording, a link's text or `href`, an image `src`/`alt`, a Tailwind color/class tweak, contact details, dates, or adding/removing/reordering an item in an existing `{#each}` array. The change is confined to markup and data already on the page.

- Locate the target (grep for the current text), make the minimal edit, validate, commit. Done.
- No plan documents, no sub-agents, no exploratory reading beyond the files the change touches.
- One focused commit.

**Standard task** — anything structural: new pages, sections, or components, forms or blog wiring, layout/navigation changes, styling overhauls, dependencies, anything multi-part. Use your normal engineering process.

**Escalate, don't plow.** If a "small" edit turns out to touch structure or ripple across files, switch to the standard process rather than forcing it through the fast path.

## Validation (tiered — never skip, never over-run)

- **Content-only edits:** `npm run check`. svelte-check catches every compile/syntax error a content change can realistically introduce; the full build is not required.
- **Structural work:** `npm run build` must pass before declaring success. A prerender error means that page needs `export const prerender = false`.
- Setup: `npm install`. Dev server: `npm run dev`.

## Tech conventions

- **Svelte 5 runes only** (`$state`, `$derived`, `$props`, `$effect`) — no Svelte 4 (`export let`, reactive `$:`, stores).
- **Plain JavaScript, no TypeScript** — use JSDoc if you need type annotations.
- **Tailwind utilities only** — no inline `style=""`, no `<style>` blocks, no CSS variables or preprocessors. Arbitrary values (`bg-[#7433ff]`) are fine.
- **Prerendering stays on** (`+layout.js`). A page that adds a server `load` or form `action` sets `export const prerender = false` on that page only.
- Most edits are UI/content in `src/routes/**/+page.svelte` and `src/lib/components/`. Match the existing structure and style.

## Page structure

- **Semantic HTML** (accessibility + SEO): proper heading hierarchy (`<h1>`/`<h2>`/`<h3>`, one `<h1>` per page), `<p>` for body copy, real `<a href>`/`<button>` for interactions, `<img>` with `alt`.
- **Repeatable content** (feature cards, testimonials, team members): declare an array in the page's `<script>` block and render with `{#each}`. These are small static sites — keep the data in the page; don't build data layers or content abstractions.
- **Anchor links** use the `/#section` format (leading slash + hash), and the target section carries the matching `id` (e.g. `<section id="services">`).
- **Navbar & Footer** are self-contained components in `src/lib/components/`, rendered **only** in `src/routes/+layout.svelte` — never in page files. **The footer keeps the Core Labs branding link** (`<a href="https://www.corelabs.digital/">Core Labs</a>`); never remove or modify it.
- **SEO head**: every `+page.svelte` keeps a `<svelte:head>` with a unique `<title>` + `<meta name="description">` (full SEO requirements in the Lighthouse section).
- **Error page**: `src/routes/+error.svelte` is the branded 404/error page (`noindex`, links back home). Restyle it alongside the rest of the site during build-out — never delete it.

## Forms

Client forms (contact, quote request, etc.) are **registered in the Core Labs CMS** and wired into the site through the CMS "Connect form to site" action, which supplies the exact submission endpoint and fields — **use the values from the task instructions verbatim.**

- **Never invent a form backend or submission URL.** The endpoint is always the CMS forms API: `https://api.corelabs.digital/api/forms/<form-slug>/submit`, where `<form-slug>` is supplied by the task. Never use a relative action, a placeholder like `__FORM_ACTION__`, or your own server route. Asked to add a form but no endpoint/slug provided? Do NOT guess — render a plain contact section (heading + copy + CTA) and say the form must be created in CMS Forms and connected via "Connect form to site."
- **Submit via `fetch()`**, not a native navigation: `method="POST"`, prevent the default submit, show a sending state and inline errors. **On success** (200 with `submission_id`), redirect the browser to the Core Labs confirmation page: `window.location.assign('https://www.corelabs.digital/f/<form-slug>/success?sid=<submission_id>')` — same `<form-slug>` as the submit URL, verbatim. Never build a local thank-you page and never settle for an inline success message (dedicated page/section forms only — chat and popup widgets are the exception, next bullet); errors stay inline (never redirect on failure). Because the POST goes to an external endpoint via `fetch`, the page does **not** need `export const prerender = false`.
- **Chat & popup widgets submit inline — the visitor never leaves the site.** A form living inside a chat-style or popup widget posts to the same canonical endpoint, but on success it shows an inline confirmation state inside the widget and never redirects (a widget submit is an incidental interaction mid-browse; ejecting the visitor to a confirmation page ends their session at the moment they showed interest). Dedicated page and section forms keep the success-page redirect above. Errors stay inline in both cases.
- **hCaptcha** (when the task says the form requires it) — **lazy explicit render, never eager**:
  - **Never load `api.js` in `<svelte:head>` or at page load**, and never use implicit auto-render (`<div class="h-captcha">` + bare `api.js`). Eager loading pulls in hundreds of KB of third-party JS on the audited page (a major Lighthouse Performance penalty), and auto-render races SvelteKit hydration — the widget intermittently fails to appear until a refresh and breaks on client-side navigation.
  - The sitekey `9f64291e-4d3a-4ae8-b4ee-5692268481b2` is Core Labs' **shared public** hCaptcha sitekey — use it verbatim; never substitute a placeholder or a per-site key (a wrong key shows "The sitekey for this hCaptcha is incorrect").
  - Render an **empty container** inside the form before the submit button, with its height reserved so the widget can't shift layout, and inject the script the first time the form **nears the viewport** (`IntersectionObserver`, `rootMargin: '300px'`) **or receives focus** — whichever happens first — in explicit-render mode with an `onload` callback (no polling loops). Reference implementation:

    ```svelte
    <script>
      import { onMount } from 'svelte'

      const HCAPTCHA_SITEKEY = '9f64291e-4d3a-4ae8-b4ee-5692268481b2'
      let formEl
      let captchaEl
      let widgetId = null

      // Idempotent: safe to call repeatedly, and across multiple forms on one page.
      function loadHcaptcha() {
        if (!window._hcaptchaLoader) {
          window._hcaptchaLoader = new Promise((resolve) => {
            window._hcaptchaOnLoad = () => resolve(window.hcaptcha)
            const s = document.createElement('script')
            s.src = 'https://js.hcaptcha.com/1/api.js?render=explicit&onload=_hcaptchaOnLoad'
            s.async = true
            document.head.append(s)
          })
        }
        window._hcaptchaLoader.then((hcaptcha) => {
          if (widgetId === null && captchaEl) {
            widgetId = hcaptcha.render(captchaEl, { sitekey: HCAPTCHA_SITEKEY })
          }
        })
      }

      onMount(() => {
        const io = new IntersectionObserver(
          (entries) => {
            if (entries.some((e) => e.isIntersecting)) {
              io.disconnect()
              loadHcaptcha()
            }
          },
          { rootMargin: '300px' }
        )
        io.observe(formEl)
        formEl.addEventListener('focusin', loadHcaptcha, { once: true })
        return () => io.disconnect()
      })
    </script>

    <form bind:this={formEl} onsubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <!-- fields … -->
      <div bind:this={captchaEl} class="mb-4 min-h-[78px]"></div>
      <!-- status area + submit button -->
    </form>
    ```

  - On submit: `const token = widgetId === null ? '' : window.hcaptcha.getResponse(widgetId)`. If it's empty, block submission and show "Please complete the CAPTCHA." inline; otherwise include it in the POST body as `h-captcha-response`. Tokens are single-use — after a failed submission response, call `window.hcaptcha.reset(widgetId)` so the visitor can retry.
- **Honeypot**: include the hidden spam field named in the task (default `website`), hidden with Tailwind utilities (not inline styles) and left empty: `<input type="text" name="website" class="absolute left-[-10000px] top-auto h-px w-px overflow-hidden" tabindex="-1" autocomplete="off" />`.
- **Field names**: use the exact posted keys from the task (typically semantic names like `name`, `email`, `phone`, `message`, `company`). Every input has an associated `<label>`.

## Mailing List Signup

Newsletter / mailing-list signups POST to the Core Labs mailing API — **never build your own backend or store emails locally.**

- **Endpoint**: `POST https://api.corelabs.digital/api/mailing-lists/<app-id>/submit`, where `<app-id>` is this site's Core Labs app id, supplied by the task instructions — **use it verbatim; never guess one or reuse an id from another site.** No app id provided? Render the section without a posting form and say the signup must be connected via the CMS.
- **Fields** (exact posted keys): `email` (required), `name` (optional), `phone_number` (optional). Send as JSON or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
- **Honeypot**: include a hidden input named `website` (hidden with Tailwind offscreen utilities, `tabindex="-1"`, `autocomplete="off"`) and leave it empty — the endpoint silently drops submissions where it is filled. Mailing-list signups do NOT use hCaptcha.
- **Submit via `fetch()`** exactly like forms: prevent the default navigation, sending → success/error states, show the `message` the endpoint returns (200 → `{ message, subscriber_id }`), reset on success. The page does **not** need `export const prerender = false`.

## Blog

Blog posts are authored in the Core Labs CMS; the site only **renders** them. Never build a local content system (markdown files, hardcoded post arrays, a CMS of your own) and never invent API URLs.

- **Endpoints** (public `GET`, CORS-enabled, return only published posts, newest first):
  - List: `https://api.corelabs.digital/blog-posts/<app-id>` → `{ blogPosts: [...], pagination: { total, limit, offset, hasMore } }` (supports `?limit=&offset=`).
  - Detail: `https://api.corelabs.digital/blog-posts/<app-id>/<post-slug>` → `{ blogPost }`.
  - Post shape: `{ id, title, slug, content, content_type, published_date, meta_title, meta_description, featured_image, created_at, updated_at }`.
- The `<app-id>` is supplied by the task instructions — **use it verbatim; never guess.** No app id → don't build blog pages; say the blog must be connected via the CMS.
- **Pages**: listing at `/blog` and detail at `/blog/[slug]` unless the task names another path. Listing cards show `featured_image`, `title`, `published_date`, and an excerpt (`meta_description` or the first paragraph), linking to the detail page. Handle the empty state gracefully ("No posts yet" — never a broken page).
- **Rendering `content`**: `content_type` is `"markdown"` or `"html"`. Markdown → convert to HTML (a small renderer like `marked` is fine, imported only on blog routes); html → inject with `{@html post.content}` (blog content is trusted CMS content).
- **Prerendering**: posts are published in the CMS **without a site redeploy**, so blog routes must NOT be prerendered. Fetch in a universal load (`+page.js`) using the load `fetch`, and set `export const prerender = false` on BOTH blog routes (listing and detail).
- **SEO**: the detail page sets `<title>` / `<meta name="description">` from `meta_title` / `meta_description` (falling back to `title` / excerpt), plus canonical + OG tags per the SEO rules — using `featured_image` as `og:image`/`twitter:image` when present — and `BlogPosting` JSON-LD (`headline`, `description`, `datePublished` from `published_date`, `dateModified` from `updated_at`, `image` from `featured_image` when present, `author` + `publisher` referencing the site's `Organization`). Add the listing path (e.g. `/blog`) to the sitemap `routes` list AND wire the sitemap's `BLOG` config with the same app id and base path — post URLs are then enumerated automatically as posts publish.

## Performance, Accessibility & SEO (Lighthouse)

Core Labs sites must score in the high 90s–100 on Google Lighthouse (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO). Preserve and extend these on every edit:

### Performance

- **Images** (biggest perf lever — LCP + CLS):
  - ALWAYS set `width` and `height` (intrinsic pixels) on every `<img>` so the browser reserves space (no layout shift).
  - Below-the-fold images: add `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"`.
  - The hero / largest above-the-fold image: do NOT lazy-load it; add `fetchpriority="high"`.
  - Prefer modern formats (`.webp`/`.avif`) and reasonably sized files; never ship a 4000px image into a 600px slot.
  - **Stock imagery (Unsplash etc.)**: download the image into `/static` and optimize it first (webp, ≤ 1920px wide for heroes / ≤ 1200px for content images, roughly ≤ 250KB) — fetch a pre-sized rendition (Unsplash supports `?auto=format&fit=crop&w=1920&q=75` at download time) or convert locally (`npx @squoosh/cli`, `sharp`, `cwebp`). Never hotlink a full-resolution stock URL. If an external image URL is unavoidable, append its CDN sizing params and add a `<link rel="preconnect">` for that origin.
  - **Hero backgrounds**: use an absolutely-positioned `<img class="absolute inset-0 h-full w-full object-cover" fetchpriority="high" width height alt>` inside a `relative` section instead of a CSS `background-image` — the browser can prioritize it and it can't shift layout.
- **Fonts**: the default is the system font stack — it costs zero bytes and is perfectly acceptable. When the brand calls for custom type, **self-host** it: `npm install @fontsource-variable/<font>` and import it once at the top of `src/app.css` (e.g. `@import '@fontsource-variable/inter';`), then reference the family in `tailwind.config.js` `theme.extend.fontFamily`. **NEVER add a `<link>` to `fonts.googleapis.com`, `use.typekit.net`, or any third-party font CSS** — render-blocking cross-origin CSS is one of the biggest Lighthouse penalties. Maximum 2 font families per site; prefer variable fonts.
- **No preloaders or splash screens.** These pages are prerendered static HTML that paints almost instantly; a loading overlay only *delays* first paint and tanks FCP/LCP. If a task asks for a "preloader", deliver polished entrance styling instead and note why.
- **Animations must not hide the LCP element.** The hero headline and hero image render visible immediately — never start them at `opacity-0` waiting for JS. Scroll-triggered reveals are for below-the-fold sections only, driven by `IntersectionObserver` (never scroll listeners), animating only `transform`/`opacity`. Count-up stat numbers: add Tailwind `tabular-nums` and render the final value in markup (animate after hydration) so there's no layout shift and no empty content for crawlers.
- **Third-party scripts & embeds**: add NO analytics, chat widgets, or tracking pixels unless the task explicitly asks; each one costs Lighthouse points. hCaptcha loads **lazily** per the Forms rules — never in `<svelte:head>`; any other genuinely required script loads `async defer` and as late as its function allows. Video embeds: `<iframe loading="lazy">` inside an `aspect-video` container, or better, a thumbnail facade that injects the iframe on click.
- No large client-side JS libraries; Svelte ships almost none by default — keep it that way.
- If the site loads images/fonts from another origin, add a `<link rel="preconnect" href="…">` for it in the page `<svelte:head>`.

### Accessibility

- Keep `<html lang="en">` (in `app.html`) and the **skip-to-content** link in `+layout.svelte`. Every page's top-level wrapper is `<main id="main-content">` so the skip link works.
- Landmarks: Navbar uses `<header>`/`<nav>`, page content uses `<main>`, Footer uses `<footer>`. Don't duplicate `<main>`.
- One `<h1>` per page; don't skip heading levels (h1 → h2 → h3).
- Every `<img>` has a meaningful `alt` (empty `alt=""` only for purely decorative images).
- Color contrast must meet WCAG AA (≥ 4.5:1 for normal text). Avoid light-gray text on white.
- Interactive elements: real `<a>`/`<button>` (never clickable `<div>`), visible focus (kept by the base styles), and tap targets ≥ 44px.
- Form inputs each have an associated `<label>`.

### SEO

- Every `+page.svelte` `<svelte:head>` has a **unique** `<title>` + `<meta name="description">`, a `<link rel="canonical">`, Open Graph (`og:*`) + Twitter tags, and JSON-LD structured data (`Organization`, or `LocalBusiness` with address/phone/hours for local clients).
- **Social share image**: every page's OG/Twitter tags include `og:image` (+ `og:image:width`/`height`) and `twitter:image` as **absolute URLs**. The default is `/og-image.png` (1200×630, ≤ 300KB, in `/static`) — the template ships a solid-color placeholder that MUST be replaced with a branded image during build-out (typically the hero image with the business name legible on it). A page with a natural page-specific image (e.g. a blog post's `featured_image`) uses that instead of the default.
- **Structured data beyond the homepage** (answer engines lean on it to cite accurately): FAQ sections add `FAQPage` JSON-LD mirroring the on-page questions and answers verbatim; service detail pages may add `Service`; pages nested more than one level deep add `BreadcrumbList`. JSON-LD must always match visible page content — never mark up content that isn't on the page.
- **`static/llms.txt`** (the AI-assistant counterpart to robots.txt): site name, a one-paragraph factual summary, key pages as absolute URLs, and core facts (service area, contact). Fill it during build-out and keep it current when pages or offerings change.
- **CMS round-trip (do not break)**: the Core Labs CMS reads a page's current SEO values from the rendered head of the live page and applies edits back to that page's `<svelte:head>`. So every page's `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, and OG/Twitter tags must be **server-rendered from that page's own `<svelte:head>`** — plain literal strings or values resolved during SSR. Never inject them client-side (`onMount`/DOM scripting) and never define a page's title/description only in a layout. Treat `title`/`og:title`/`twitter:title` and `description`/`og:description`/`twitter:description` as one unit: when one changes, keep its counterparts in sync.
- **Studio preview beacon (do not remove)**: the root `+layout.svelte` posts `{ type: 'corelabs:preview-path', path: location.pathname }` to `window.parent` on every navigation, only when the site is embedded in an iframe. The Core Labs Studio uses it to know which page its preview is showing (e.g. the SEO editor opens scoped to that page). Keep the snippet in the root layout; it must never send more than the path.
- Keep `static/robots.txt` and the `sitemap.xml` route valid; add new routes to the sitemap's `routes` list. Replace every `example.com` placeholder (page `siteUrl`, robots.txt, sitemap `SITE`, llms.txt) with the real domain during build-out — once a custom domain is attached, the production build **fails** if any placeholder survives (vite `placeholder-seo-guard`). The sitemap route is dynamic (`prerender = false` — never flip it) so CMS-published blog posts appear without a redeploy; when the site has a connected blog, its `BLOG` config must be wired.
- Descriptive link text (not "click here"); external links use `rel="noopener"` (add `noreferrer` for untrusted).

### Never strip on "cleanup"

Canonical/OG/JSON-LD tags, image `width`/`height`, the skip link, `lang`, or landmark elements — they are functional, not decorative.

## Legacy section markers

Older pages contain HTML comments like `<!-- section:hero {"type":"hero","id":"hero-123"} -->` … `<!-- /section:hero -->`. These served a retired visual editor — **nothing reads them anymore.**

- Do NOT add them to new sections, and don't maintain their JSON metadata.
- You may delete them from sections you're already editing.
- Don't do a repo-wide marker cleanup pass unless a task explicitly asks for it.
